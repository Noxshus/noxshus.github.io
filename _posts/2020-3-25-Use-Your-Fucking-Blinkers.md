title: Use Your Fucking Blinkers
---

Today I'm going to talk to you about my favourite text, *Meditations* and why, despite being written close to 2 millennia ago, it can help us deal with two modern scourges:

- Anxiety
- Using one's blinkers

### Suck My Balls, Gladiator

*Meditations* was authored by Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, probably best known for his role as Russell Crowe's mate in the first act of *Gladiator*. He's quickly murdered by his son, Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who wanted his job. After being falsely accused of something or other, Russell Crowe eventually finds out that Commodus murdered his friend, so he beats his ass and dies vindicated. In reality, Marcus died of the plague and he got on really well with his son, Commodus, but ok.

[TRIVIA: Pouty Commodus was, in actual fact, a GIANT NARCISSISTIC BEEFCAKE who himself used to fight in the arena as a gladiator, much to the chagrin of the Roman people. He was pretty good at it, with Cassius Dio claiming that he killed 100 lions in a day, just in-case you were impressed by Russell Crowe taking on a single tiger ([which makes lion sounds btw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAf1w_ruXeY)).]

Anyway, aside from his supporting role in *Gladiator*, Marcus Aurelius spent nearly his entire life on campaign to secure Rome's borders. Marcus, an adherent of stoic philosophy, maintained something of a diary throughout this period, in-order to keep track of his reflections. Though he didn't give the collection a title (likely because he never intended to have it published), it's come to be known simply as *Meditations*.

### On Meditations - Anxiety

Above all, *Meditations* is emblematic of the human condition. Marcus Aurelius was a human being, with very real and very relatable anxieties, in-spite of him controlling an empire that looked like this, **1800** years ago:

So, next time you're berating yourself for feeling shitty, remember that even the guy in charge of the entire Western world regularly had pangs of self-doubt.

Probably the most commonly cited extract is the following:

**When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil.**

Taken out of context, this is sometimes understood to mean that one should excuse shitty behaviour, simply because the person that did us harm didn't know any better. However, the intention behind this is slightly more intricate: it's that we should avoid burdening ourselves with things that are outside of our control. This is both a re-occurring theme throughout *Meditations* and a fundamental tenant of Stoicism as a philosophy, in that the focus of our improvement should always be directed inwards, towards something we can actually change.

This mindset isn't limited to just when others are dicks to us, but also when we're tempted to look upon our peers. We've all heard the phrase: "The grass is greener on the other side", but the Dutch version of the phrase is perhaps more appropriate here: "Het gras bij de buurman is altijd groener", or 'The **neighbour's** grass is always greener". Marcus has words for precisely this:

**How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.**

Consider that Marcus wrote this long before modern methods of communication, but if anything, it's even more relevant today. A lack of context about others can keep us from seeing things as they really are: it's both tempting, easy and even comforting to believe that another person's life is truly perfect and that, one day, ours might be just as serene and free of hardship.

Yet, reality is bleak. Your best efforts might not (and may never) bear any fruit one might even consider that to be discouraging, when the realisation hits you and you begin to come to terms with the fact that you may never become the idealised version of yourself. We could settle our thoughts there, in that shitty dark space, but we can take it one step further: if you don't need to follow a predefined treadmill towards mimicked success and petty victories (because you can never get there), then you may realise that you are free. Free to focus on being the best version of you.

After all, Marcus points out:

**There is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and never return.**

&

**Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.**

The truth is, simply, that we're going to die and we only really get one shot at this, so we might as well make the most of it while we can, as soon as we can. There's little reason to spend time worrying over things outside of our control, when there are things within that control, which we can effect.

Sure, we might not produce life-changing work on a daily basis, but Marcus offers more here:

**Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human--however imperfectly--and fully embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on.**

[Patrick Steward says it best.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4A-Ml8YHyM)

To summarise: get out of bed, don't be a dick and work hard. Don't hurt others; even simply from a practical point of view, it's both a waste of time (which you don't have a lot of) and conversely, improving their situation can benefit you too. Be proud of your work because it's yours and you (and only you) did it. If it's shit: learn from it, do it better next time. If it's good: learn from it, do it better next time.

### On Meditations - Using Your Fucking Blinker

This is all well and good, but so far, I've been very fluffy. So, to bring us back to the title of this piece, here's a practical example on how you can better, right fucking now: use your blinkers.

Here's a list of reasons why you should:

- It tells people what you intend to do. This includes pedestrians that aren't shielded from your steel death machine and cannot react as quickly.
- It's the law.
- It doesn't require a lot of effort.
- It's within your realm of control. You can be better, right now.

You're good enough already; don't be a cunt.
