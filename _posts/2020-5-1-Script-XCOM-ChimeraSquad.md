title: Script - A Critique of XCOM Chimera Squad
---

*This is the script for the following video essay: LINK GOES HERE*

The name "XCOM" is synonymous with turn-based tactical games. While the original game was neither the first in the genre {*Panzer Strike* 1987 probably holds that title}, nor the most prolific {*Fire Emblem*}, it is probably the most charming, with its frustrating accuracy calculations {clips of 90%+ misses} & peak 90s camp {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX0Cm3N_n6k} garnering it a cult following that's persisted through several sequels {}, a reboot {1&2} and even an ok spin-off {*The Bureau*}.

In-spite of both the pedigree and perseverance that comes with the XCOM name, *Chimera Squad* is a strange entry. It released at a far lower price than one usually expects (20€, discounted to €10 for its week of release){steam price tag}, so it's obviously not intended as a main entry into the series. Still, even when looked at through a lens of compassion (you get what you pay for, after all), it falls short in several areas. {bug clips} Sometimes, these areas are exactly the same as the reboots, which after working with the same engine for 7 years one would hope they'd have started to iron out by now, but ok.

Anyway, *Chimera Squad*'s issues can roughly be divided into 2: lack of information and excessive randomness. By their powers combined, I name them Captain Frustration.

The first issue, a lack of information, is not new. Both the reboot and its sequel would frequently leave out critical information like skill cooldown time, number of uses per mission and range. *Chimera Squad* tooltips are only consistent in how inconsistent they are.

Information in a strategy game is essential; it is perhaps the most essential aspect of strategic play. You cannot make an informed, strategic decision if you aren't afforded all the information necessary to make that decision. 

No one plays XCOM for its narrative components. The overarching narrative has always been simple: "Go beat aliens! Woah, the aliens are doing some nasty stuff. It's best we beat the aliens some more". Perhaps the only narrative element of substance in XCOM was, instead, the one that players could make up in their own head. By this, I mean that, traditionally, players of the XCOM series have always been afforded the option to customise their squad, at least to some degree. Originally, this was just the option to re-name individual squad members, but with the reboots, Firaxis added numerous options for the aesthetic customisation of one's squad. Their further support for modding tools allowed players themselves to add all sorts of ridiculous accessories {add clip of the XCOM 2 modding}. This provided a sense of ownership that very few games really support.

Ironically, it might even be less so in the case of *Chimera Squad*. Even though it's got a pre-constructed narrative, it's vapid and generic. Players are offered a selection of 11 unique squad mates (all painstakingly voiced & textured), but they don't actually offer anything in-terms of narrative substance. For example, there's no character development or unique missions. They'll occasionally make a qip before a mission sometimes, but they're usually as one-dimensional as the characters themselves. In-fact, I recall only a singular instance of an interesting conversation {convo with godmother & cherub near the end}. 

The entire narrative component of *Chimera Squad* could have been ripped right out and it wouldn't have been lesser experience for it. Actually, it might have been **more** for it - I think my XCOM experience would have been several orders more exciting if I could give my mate Steve a porn-star moustache and bask in awe as he mows down opponent after opponent.

The isometric perspective of XCOM practically lends itself to the imagination; 



The first is the newly introduced system of reinforcements, 




while the second is not so new: Firaxis inability to write descriptive tooltips. 



but simply by virtue of including the series name carries with it a number of expectations that simply aren't met.

- There's a huge, huge variety of maps.

The only XCOM thing about this is that the % chances are truly unweighed and it's a turn-based tactical game.



Though this isn't the first time publisher 2K has used the XCOM name for a spin-off (cough *The Bureau: XCOM Declassified* cough), *XCOM: Chimera Squad* comes from the same development studio that brought to bear both the 2012 reboot of *XCOM: Enemy Unknown* and its much loved sequel, *XCOM 2*.
