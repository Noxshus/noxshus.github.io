title: On the Vulnerable

I usually try to avoid publicly commenting on political issues, but in this case, I think it's closer to a moral one -

Backpedaling on newly introduced law sets a horrific precedent, on many fronts. It undermines the legal system, the work put in to enforce it and it's insulting to the people that made sacrifices to obey it. This is especially more so when the sacrifice cost livelihoods and went against something that's fundamentally human, which is to be social.

That said, above all, it strikes at something that I would consider to not only be fundamentally civil, but also of Maltese society as a whole: protecting the vulnerable. 

The reasoning behind social distancing is that, because there are several persons especially susceptible to COVID-19, everyone must exercise a degree of quarantine to protect them. Providing amnesty to those people that disregarded the well-being of the weak (an act that could have resulted in something akin to manslaughter) for their own meagre, selfish gain is so incredibly fucked up.

I simply cannot think of a greater marker of a moral society than the protection of the vulnerable. I hesitate to draw such a clich√© comparison, but a common theme of 1930s fascism was to disregard the well-being of the weak & infirm. It's the first step to eroding egalitarianism - but perhaps I shouldn't be surprised in this regard, because our PM has already set precedent in this regard by considering himself (and his mates) to be above the law. The phrase "First among equals," does not mean "I do what I want because I'm the best," it means: "I'm the very best at showing my countrymen what it means to be part of an egalitarian society, by adhering to all rules & regulations, both moral and legal."

I struggle to understand what could have led to this, short of undue influence behind the scenes, because it would take someone that is either not of sound mind, or lacking in good moral character (or both) to think this is a reasonable thing to do. To disregard so many echelons of civil society, from the officers of the law that keep us safe, to the medical professionals that keep us healthy, to the old & vulnerable on whose back was built upon... fuck me for being, once again, cautiously optimistic that we could have a leader of moral substance thicker than a fucking toothpick.
