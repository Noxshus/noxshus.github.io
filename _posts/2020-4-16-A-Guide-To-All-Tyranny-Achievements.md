title: A Guide to All Tyranny Achievements
---

This is a step-by-step, spoiler-heavy, guide to acquiring all of [Tyranny](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362960/Tyranny/)'s achievements. It'll require at least 4 play-throughs, but as *Tyranny* features a new game+ system, later runs will take less time. Following this guide will also hit just about all the content, both mechanical and narrative, in the game so it's also ideal for people that would like to experience everything.

Somewhat frustratingly, there's actually 5 ways to resolve the Bastard's Wound (each with their own achievement), so in one instance, I suggest making a save at a particular point (I'll point it out), to pick it up before reloading.

My primary point of reference throughout this compilation is fabula_rasa's achievement guide on Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1269188681. If you need more information about a particular achievement, this is where I'd recommend you go. Please give them a like & favourite. 

### Mechanics of Tyranny

Before we begin, some notes about *Tyranny* and making one's life easier:

- Character progression *Tyranny* is somewhat unique: a character has both a traditional 'level', as well as skills which level up individually through use (e.g. bashing someone on the head makes you better at the weapon you used to bash them with). A character gains a level when they gain enough levels in other skills. The unique part is that advancement in skills is *party wide*. This means that if one of your party members bashes someone in the head, your entire team (including your main character) will get better at that skill. This can cause things to 'snowball' somewhat, as a high skill level opens up more options, which in-turn results in more experience.

- At character creation, spread all your skill points across Lore, Athletics and Subterfuge. These 3 skills unlock hundreds of interactions and in-turn reward experience for the respective skill. As long as you keep selecting options that require them, you'll likely never meet a skill check you can't succeed past Act 1 of the first run.

- Magic is by far the path of least resistance. There are spells for every occasion and then some. As all characters can also use magic, at least to some degree, there is no reason not to have spells equipped on your entire party, even on archetypes that you wouldn't traditionally associate with magic usage. Combined with *Tyranny*'s character progression, having everyone use magic will progressively make your entire party better at magic related skills. Above all, it's the most innovative and enjoyable part-of *Tyranny*, so go ham.

- While *Tyranny* is a real-time-with-pause style of RPG, characters actually have to wait a variable amount of time before making their next action. This is called "Recovery". Generally, because magic is king, items which increase recovery time significantly are to be avoided, because it increases the amount of time a character has to wait before casting their next spell. Therefore, it's a good idea to avoid putting your team in heavy armour, if you can avoid it. Magic provides several forms of defence, as well as healing, so armour is not particularly important in *Tyranny*. However (this will more likely be true on your second run onwards), there are several sigils of magic that impact recovery time, which are % based. Putting these on heavily armoured characters can make for some ridiculous cheese. Haste (Force + Guarded Form) with a Pride Magic sigil comes to mind.

- Companions in *Tyranny* have specific alignments, but will generally stick with you regardless of the choices you make (with 1 exception, which I'll mention later). In subsequent playthroughs, these values will reset, so you'll be free to explore the opposite interactions too.

- Sell everything you possibly can at the end of a run, because money transfers over.

- On new game plus, enemies will initially be significantly harder than you're used to, because they're scaled up to your level. However, they'll be quickly outpaced again by Act 2.

### First Run

- Preparation begins even before we start. There's 2 achievements tied to difficulty: **Iron Victory** & **Victory of the Damned**. The former is an 'ironman' mode of sorts where you only have 1 save file, which is deleted if your party dies. The latter requires a win on the highest difficulty. *Tyranny* is only particularly challenging initially, as your ever-increasing magic skill will eventually trivialise everything, even on the highest difficulty.
- There's also one other achievement which I consider to be somewhat related to difficulty: **Zero Consumption**. This requires that the player never consume a healing potion in a playthrough, which is trivial on "Story Mode". However, this is a value *which persists through new game +*, so it's something that should be dealt with early.

With those in-mind, I would recommend that one's first playthough is:

- On Story Mode difficulty. This will make **Zero Consumption** much easier and on subsequent playthroughs we'll be able to use healing potions.
- *Not* on Trial of Iron. Assuming this is your first time playing Tyranny, I'd recommend running through the game once with the option to save & reload if necessary.
- Siding with the Scarlett Chorus.

#### First Run - Conquest

Bastard's City: Doesn't really matter.

- Infiltrate the Tiers: Conscript enemy fighters for the Scarlet Chorus
- Inside Agent: A fast-talking smuggler 
- Betrayal of the Bastard City: Incite a riot 

Lethian's Crossing: The Chorus need control of the crossing for the purpose of an achievement.

- The Cult of Sirin: Send Sirin's cult to the vanguard (this gives major Loyalty with Sirin)
- A Red Anvil: Erase his mind 
- Who Controlled the Crossing? : Choose the Scarlet Chorus

Vellum Citadel: Need to give warning to the sages to open up an achievement later.

- Song of Ensnarement: Punish the Disfavored 
- The Spymaster's Agents? : Release the mages to the Scarlet Chorus 
- Edict of Fire: Give one day's warning 

#### First Run - Organic Achievements

There's several achievements that you will very likely get in your first playthrough with little to no effort. 3 of them are completely unavoidable, so I will not mention them. Many of the others will be done completely organically, so there's no need to go out of your way for them, but here they are just-in-case:

**Magnetic Personality**: Recruit every companion in the game. Short of saying "yes" whenever someone offers to join, there are 2 things to note:

- You can murder Eb the first time you meet her. Don't and she'll be available later.
- You can recruit Siren in Act II, from Lethian’s Crossing.

**Inspiring Leader**: Reach 5 Loyalty with any companion. Verse is the easiest, especially on this playthrough since we're siding with the Scarlett Chorus; simply select every favour granting option & do her quests when available. You can check what option which options will grant reputation by ticking the following box in the options menu:

![reputation](\images\showrep.png)

**Chorus of Victory**: Complete the run allied to the Scarlet Chorus. This is the main objective of this run; simply side with the Chorus at the Ascension Hall and never change your mind.

**Charismatic**: Max out Favour with a faction. This one will happen naturally with the Scarlett Chorus on this run.

**Intimidating**: Max out Wrath with a faction. Consequently, you'll piss off the Disfavoured naturally on this run and you'll get this organically.

**Building a Reputation**: Acquire a faction reputation ability. This will happen long before doing either of the above by accident.

**Correspondence Course**: Reply to any missive in the game. I don't think any of the missives are essential, but there's no reason not to reply to them either, so might as well!

**Legendary**: Acquire an artifact - you'll get this by accident.

**Arsenal**: Fairly easily done by crafting artifacts at a spire. You'll probably get this by accident too.

**I Am The Law**: Talk to people that are squabbling in various areas. You can pick literally any judgement - in-fact the trigger seems to be before the judgement is made. Unsure how many it takes to get this, but this achievement is very easy and will likely be gotten by accident.

**Perceptive**: Discover 25 Hidden Objects. This will happen by accident.

#### First Run - Act 1 Achievements

**Day of Swords**: This is a bit of a joke achievement. Save at some point in Act 1 and keep sleeping in either the tent at the Disfavoured or Scarlett Chorus map, until the Act 1 timer runs out, which will cause a gave over screen. Reload once you've gotten the achievement.

#### First Run - Act 2 Lethian's Crossing Achievements

Note: You can go to Lethian's Crossing first to do these two achievements, pick up Sirin and activate the Spire, even though we're actually going to take the Burning Library quest from the Voices.

**Solo Performance**: This is only possible if you went to Lethian's Crossing and left the Scarlett Chorus in charge. Visit the brothel (The Sword Or Sheath), talk to the owner and ask him about his 'beauties'. After exhausting the list, he'll offer you a solo room - spend some time there for this achievement.

**Boom**: At Lethian's Crossing, inside The Forge, keep clicking on the Forge-Bound Apprentice that's striking the anvil until he explodes (it takes quite a few clicks & he might repeat dialogue, but keep at it).

**Some Assembly Required**: Once you acquire the first spire, the one at Lethian's Crossing, simply pick an upgrade for it for this achievement.

#### First Run - Act 2 Burning Library Achievements

Note: It's important to tell the Voices that you're heading to the Burning Library, when given the option.

**Unconventional Materials**: Cut the Rune from the Sage's Chest in the Burning Library. This extremely specific achievement is only available if you gave the Sages a warning during the Conquest stage (A Chorus-leaning choice). Ensure you have Lantry with you before heading to the Burning Library, where a new area in the south-east corner of the Lower Ruins ( the '2nd' area) has appeared. Once there, an event will trigger and your attention is drawn to a Sage drowning in lava. Lantry will note a sigil on the sage's chest, which you can opt to cut out. If you don't have Lantry with you, you can also notice this on your own with enough Lore skill.

Note: At the end of the Burning Library quest, I would recommend replacing the Silent Archive with another artifact. This unlocks an additional area in the Burning Library, on the first level, where you can kill a Havoc for the **Cry Havoc!** achievement (as well as granting access to 2 artifacts).

Note: It doesn't really matter where you go next. While there's no specific achievements for it on a Chorus run, the Blade Grave is the more interesting option and includes another of the Havocs for **Cry Havoc!**. You'll encounter said Havoc in the Blade Grave Oldwalls. 

Once that area is conquered, the  Bastard's Wound areas will become available.

#### First Run - Bastard's Wound Achievements

Note: Take Lantry with you & whatever you do, DO NOT KILL LEXEME.
Note: You can also do **They Sort of Deserver It...** on this run. For some reason, Lexeme doesn't count as a Sleepless and Reef-Talon won't kill her. However, I don't think it's thematically appropriate to do so on this run & I'd recommend simply killing Reef-Talon so that you can at least see that outcome.

**Troubleshooter**: Complete all the Bastard's Wound quests. While I've put this here, I'd recommend following this achievement through on the 1st, 3rd & 4th runs (not possible on the 2nd) anyway for the rewards.

- Once in the Bastard's Wound for the first time, after talking to Mell, talk to Jaspos and Wagstaff to pick up their quests (“Knapping on the Job” and “Tide Together”). Be sure to do **Well Done** while on Jaspos' quest.
- Go and do both of those, come back and return them. **Do not pick up any other quests yet**.
- Pick up & do the following 3 quests: “Gambler’s Ruin” from Rostrom Len, “Midnight Wanderer” from Eisly and “Water Intoxication” from Tycho at Bastard’s Wound Farm.
- Afterwards, you can decide who to support and pick up a quest from that person: “History of the Oldwalls” form Mell, “Blood of the Beast” from Wagstaff or “Bones of the Beast” from Jaspos. In this case, I would recommend doing "Blood of the Beast", Wagstaff's quest, since he's the most thematically appropriate for the Chorus.
- Follow the quest chain to its conclusion; the achievement will unlock after picking a leader. See **Prince of Tidecasters** & **Complicit Justice** below.

**Well Done**: During Jaspos' quest, “Knapping on the Job”, use the lie option on Cassandra, telling her that you decided to let her keep her tools. After that, talk to Capteron to wait until nightfall. In the southern-end of the villager, there's a villager next to the well that you can push into it, which will grant this achievement. 

![reputation](\images\shovevillager.png)

**Sleepless in Three Battles**: You'll get this by accident while wandering the Oldwalls - there's enough hostile Sleepless for this by default.

**Complicit Justice**: You might recall that I mentioned there's 5 ways to resolve the Bastard's Wound questline, so we'll need to do a bit of save-scumming here. At the very end of the Bastard's Wound questline, when it's time to pick a leader, *make a fresh save* and choose to walk away from the meeting. You'll know it's time when you pop out of the portal to see Jaspos, Wagstaff, Mell & Reef-Talon (probably subdued) standing around one another. After exiting the Wound, this achievement should pop. Afterwards, reload and continue as usual.

**Prince of Tidecasters**: Pick Wagstaff as the leader.

#### First Run - Act 2 Stone Sea Achievements

**Savage Stone**: When you enter the Gulfglow Oldwalls, you'll meet some Earthshakers. Avoid immediately attacking them (you can pretend not to be aligned to the Chorus) and offer to speak to the Stonestalker leader, Red-Fang, at the Gulfglow Runic Hall to try and resolve the problem peacefully. Follow her quest, “Rite of Savagery and Stone”, for this achievement.

Note: If you'd like to resolve the conflict peacefully (keeping the Earthshakers alive too), simply growl at Red-Fang after you've finished the rite.

**Cry Havoc!**: Kill 3 Havocs. Finishing **Savage Stone** will open up this achievement too. You'll have already killed 2 Havocs by now (assuming you've been following this guide so far). There'll be only one left.
- Burning Library – Upper Ruins - Appeared when the lava at the Burning Library receded, which occurs if you do not destroy the Burning Library (by replacing the Silent Archive with another artifact).
- Blade Grave Oldwalls – Central - Killed while on the quest to claim Sentinel Stand Keep and the neighbouring spire (again assuming you've been following this guide).
- Passage of Culling - This Havoc becomes accessible via a quest “The Culling Dance”. This quest is by Speaks-for-Soil, who's at Stonestalker camp in Stone Down Gorge, but it requires that you have already completed the “Rite of Savagery and Stone” quest.

If you missed this achievement, you'll also very likely get it by accident on the Rebel run.

**All You Survey**: Gain control of all the Spires. The Spires become available as you progress through Act 2 - by the end of the Stone Sea segment, they'll all be available. Simply claim them for this achievement.

**Look On My Works, Ye Mighty...**: Upgrade all the spires. As long as you've been upgrading them as soon as you claim them (no reason not to really), you'll get this achievement.

#### First Run - Act 3 Achievements

Note: These achievements are listed in-order that they should be pursued.

**Truth and Reconciliation**: Complete Lantry's companion quests. It's absolutely critical that you do not kill Lexeme at any point, or you won't be able to receive the 2nd quest in Act 3.

**High as the Mountain Spire**: This is related to Lantry's 2nd quest, "Annal Sects”. You can do this immediately after: interact with the berry bush (again) in the Indigo Fields while in a full party. However, Siren doesn't count. 

**The Prosecution Rests**: Convict an Archon in Tunon's court. This is best done in either this run, or the next. When you're summoned for trial by Tunon, you'll first be able to present evidence against one of the Archons. On this run, you should pick the Graven Ashe, as you'll need to kill him for Barik's companion quest anyway. Tunon will summon Bleden Mark to do the deed, but I'd recommend asking to go execute him yourself, as the Iron Hearth is an enjoyable section. Important notes:

- If you fight Bleden Mark before the trial, you won't be able to convict either Archon.
- If you murdered Graven Ashe, or the Voices of Nerat before going to the trial, you also won't be able to convict either of them.

**Change of Carapace**: Complete Barik's companion quests. This can be done on any playthrough. The only 'trick' is that, in your conversations with Barik, never agree with him when he suggests staying in his armour. In this playthrough, as we're siding with the Chorus, you'll have to kill Graven Ashe to free Barik of his commitment.

**Sloppy Seconds**: After completing Barik's companion quests, travel between areas until a random event occurs where you can suggest that Barik bathes. Select the 3rd option, to leave. For some reaosn this achievement doesn't trigger immediately - you'll have to wait till the end of the run for it to appear.

**Let the Next Verse Begin**: Complete Verse's companion quests. At the end, with a Loyalty of at least 3, allow the Voices of Nerat to take Verse. There's another quest related to Verse's companion quest, but we'll do that on another run.

**Paved with Good Intentions**: As a consequence of **Let the Next Verse Begin**, you'll also acquire this achievement.

**Final Judgement**: Force Tunon to submit to you. Following the Trial of the Archons & executing your archon of choice you'll also have to argue for yourself. Preferably, bring 3 companions with you which have a Loyalty of 3+ and also have a Favor of 4 with Tunon. As long as you're respectful to Tunon, he should concede your innocence. If you miss this, you can also pick this up in the second run.

**Apocalypse Later**: At the end of the game, do not cast the Edict on the Northern Empire and instead just affirm your Loyalty to Kyros.

### Second Run

Now that you've had a chance to get the hang of it, our second run will be:

- In Path of Iron mode (for **Iron Victory**)
- ...but on Story Mode again, so no worries.
- Siding with the Disfavoured.

#### Second Run - Conquest

Bastard's City: Again, doesn't really matter.
- Gates of Judgement: Join battle alongside the Disfavoured
- Feeding the Host: Confiscate merchant caravans
- Taking the Bastard City: Assault on the main gates

Lethian's Crossing: No difference really, but I would avoid gaining Fear with Sirin, as she's quite anti-Chorus, so will likely be who you gravitate towards for your party.
- The Iron Must Flow: Draw from the Scarlet Chorus recruits
- Pick of the Armoury: Choose the Disfavoured
- Who Controlled the Crossing?: Choose the Disfavoured

Stalwart: Some stuff here that's unique to the Disfavoured.
Marching on Empty: Punish the Scarlet Chorus (unlocks a supply cache)
Better Dead Than Red: Deny the Scarlet Chorus their right to conscription
The Edict of Storms: Give no warning (unlocks an artifact helm)


#### Second Run - Organic Achievements

**Tyrant**: Reach 5 Fear with any companion. The easiest person to do this with, across all runs, is Eb on a Disfavoured run. Kicking Tarkis Arry off the Spire alone will net you huge fear.

**Legion of Victory**: Complete the run allied to the Disfavoured. This is the main objective of this run; simply side with the Disfavoured at the Ascension Hall and never change your mind.

#### Second Run - 1st Act Achievements

**A Slow Death**: Execute Tarkis Demos near the start of the game.

**This! Is! Tyranny!**: Kick Tarkis Arry off the Spire at the end of Act 1. Note that this generates A LOT of Fear with Eb. This could have been done in the previous run, but it seems like the most roleplay appropriate with Disfavoured, who prefer to execute their prisoners.

#### Second Run - 2nd Act Achievements

Note: When offered a choice, go to the Burning Library, not Lethian's Crossing. You can, however, visit Lethian's Crossing regardless to acquire the spire.

**Feel The Burn**: Destroy the Burning Library. This is done naturally on this run, as it's part-of the Disfavoured questline, as long as you visit the Burning Library.

**Lawyered**: This achievement requires saving Amelia's child through a legal loophole. Following the attack on Sentinel Keep, you'll discover that Amelia has a child, which you'll otherwise need to murder to end the Edict of Storms. If you went to the Burning Library as suggested above, you'll have picked up an item that allows you to circumvent having to kill the child.

#### Second Run - Bastard's Wound Achievements

**Bastard Wounder**: During your initial conversation with Mell, condemn everyone trespassing in the Oldwalls and proceed to murder them. Note:
- There's people living inside the dwellings, so don't forget those
- Cairn's Passage, the Fractured Depths and the Darkened Hollow are included, so you have to murder everyone there too.
- Some enemies will not appear hostile - you can talk to them to off them with a text prompt.
- Remember to also murder Lexeme and Reef-Talon in the Abyss.

Note that this will prevent you from completing Lantry's companion quests on this run.

**Nice to Meat You**: During your killing spree, you'll run across a slab of meat on someone's corpse that can be equipped as a weapon. Simply kill anyone with it (doesn't have to be in the Oldwalls).

**I’ve Made A Huge Miss Steak**: Using the same slab of meat described above, keep swinging the meat until you have a critical miss. This is more likely if the person using the meat has low one-handed skill & finesse.

#### Second Run - 3rd Act Achievements

Note: If you condemn the Voices in the trial (very to similar to how we condemned Ashe in the first run), you'll be able to murder the Voices with the blessing of the court.

**Unfinished Business**: Complete Verse's companion quests. This is similar to **Let the Next Verse Begin** from the previous run, but on this one, you can kill the Voices of Nerat at the end of Verse's quests to get this achievement instead.

**Might Makes Right**: Convince Graven Ashe to submit to you. Can only be done on this run & requires at least 4 Favor (with him) to convince him.

### Third Run

- On this run, we'll have no specific difficulty settings, but I would perhaps recommend turning it up to at least Normal, so that the transition to Path of the Damned on the next run won't be as jarring.
- We'll be following the anarchist path.

#### Third Run - Conquest

Bastard's City: Matters even less on Anarchy as we don't really care about anyone liking us.
- Gates of Judgement: Join battle alongside the Disfavoured
- To Judge the Enemy: Conscript the enemy 
- Taking the Bastard City : Sabotage the city's defenses: Assault on the main gates

Apex: Here I picked 2 choices that unlock 2 otherwish inaccessible bits of content.
- The Battle of Edgering Pass: Side with the Scarlet Chorus [Unlocks an abandoned cache]
- Swords of the Fallen: Refute all charges [Unlocks Razed village in Vendrien's Well]
- The Fall of Apex: Negotiate surrender

Azure: Nothing special here either, but trying to even it out between the two factions.
- The Destruction of Azure: Dismiss the Scarlet Chorus complaints
- Forced Into the Fray: Free the mages
- The Edict of Stone: Send both armies to delay Cairn 

#### Third Run - Organic Achievements

**Chaotic Victory**: Complete an anarchy run. You can actually swap to this path quite a few times, but the earliest you can do so is at the Ascension Hall, which you can instead claim for yourself.

**Overkill**: Craft 10 artifacts. Unlike the other artifact achievements, this needs a bit more effort, but is easiest to do on this path, as it's practically the objective. A list of artifacts can be found on the Wiki: https://tyranny.gamepedia.com/Artifacts. Remember that, by now, you'll have carried forward 3 artifacts from previous runs, so this will be even easier.

**Made To Be Broken**: Break all the Edicts. This can be done on the Chorus or Disfavoured path too, but is easiest on this one, as you follow the quest in all areas.
- Edict of Fire: Broken when destroying the Burning Library.
- Edict of Stone: Broken when killing Cairn (there's another achievement for it further down).
- Edict of Storms: Broken either by killing Amelia’s baby or by using the Lore circumvention (The **Lawyered** achievement described previously).

#### Third Run - 2nd Act Achievements

Note: You don't need to make any particular choices on the Anarchy run - you can go anywhere you like.

**Taking a Stand**: Claim Sentinel Keep for yourself. This can only be done on this path, but there's no breadcrumb quest to lead you there. If you travel there on your own accord, you'll be able to lay claim to it.

**Bane of the Crossing**: You'll get this naturally on the anarchy path, at the end of Lethian's Crossing main quest.

**Shattered Stone**: After you acquire the Azure Shield, return to Hundred-Blood, who will unlock the Howling Rock area for you, where you wipe out the Earthshakers and kill Cairn for this achievement.

#### Third Run - Bastard's Wound Achievements

**Requiem for the Somnombulists**: This requires killing all of the Sleepless in the Bastard's Wound:
- Similar to the **Bastard Wounder** achievement, we'll need to kill all the Sleepless in the Fractured Depths and the Darkened Hollow. Remember that some of them are not hostile, but can be killed via text prompts.
- Sentence Lexeme to death in the Abyss. You might want to finish Lantry's 1st companion quest first, but the 2nd will not become available.
- Trick Reef-Talon into killing the remaining Sleepless (described below, in the **They Sort of Deserve It…** achievement)

**They Sort of Deserver It...**: Straight from fabula_rasa's guide, you need to pick the following conversation options with Reef-Talon. I suspect the conversation is slightly bugged, as the option only appears after selecting one of the questions twice:

- “It’s time for you to return to the Wound, in one form or another”
- “Return to the Wound. You can be of help there – perhaps even lead the settlers”
- “You’re only running because the Sleepless remind you of your guilt. If I could help them find peace, would you return?”
- “Yes. What other choice do we have?”
- “You’re only running because the Sleepless remind you of your guilt. If I could help them find peace, would you return?”
- “[Athletics 56] [Yell at her.] You need to take responsibility and end their suffering! Only you can do that!”
- “[Subterfuge 61] If someone seriously hurt your cub, but did so by accident, would you rather they mercifully end the creature, or would you prefer they prolong the cub’s suffering to ease their guilt?"

**Set in Stone**: Pick Jaspos as the leader of the Bastard's Wound at the end of the quest.

#### Third Run - 3rd Act Achievements

**From the Shadows**: Have Bleden Mark turn on Tunon. Only possible on this run. You'll need at least 4 Favor with Bleden and have completed the "Final Hunt” quest before going to the trial. You can either attack Tunon right away, or lose the trial - Bleden will show up to help you either way.

### Fourth Run

On the last stretch, our settings will be as follows:

- On Path of the Damned difficulty (for **Victory of the Damned**). Don't worry - if you've been sequentially putting in New Game + so far, this will really not be much of a challenge.
- Following the Rebel path

#### Fourth Run - Conquest

We can do exactly the same choices as the Anarchy run:

Bastard's City:
- Gates of Judgement: Join battle alongside the Disfavoured
- To Judge the Enemy: Conscript the enemy 
- Taking the Bastard City : Sabotage the city's defenses: Assault on the main gates

Apex: Negotiating surrender has a significant impact on the rebel run.
- The Battle of Edgering Pass: Side with the Scarlet Chorus [Unlocks an abandoned cache]
- Swords of the Fallen: Refute all charges [Unlocks Razed village in Vendrien's Well]
- The Fall of Apex: Negotiate surrender

Azure:
- The Destruction of Azure: Dismiss the Scarlet Chorus complaints
- Forced Into the Fray: Free the mages
- The Edict of Stone: Send both armies to delay Cairn 

#### Fourth Run - Organic Achievements

**Victorious Alliance**: Complete the run allied to the Rebels. This one needs a little bit more work than the other alignments: 

- Let Matani Sybil go during “The Battle of Echocall Crossing”
- Let Pelox Florian go during “Taking the Outer Valley” 

If you done correctly, you will receive a missive from Tarkis Arri inviting you to a meeting. Go there and agree to help out.

**How the Mighty Have Fallen**: Kill Graven Ashe, the Voices of Nerat, Tunon the Adjudicator, and Bleden Mark on the same run. This is mostly naturally done in this path, while siding with the Rebels. Just remember to murder Tunon.

**Arcanist**: Create a spell from all 11 schools of magic. I imagine that many players will already have gotten this one by accident by now, but just in-case, a list of sigils and their locations can be found here: https://tyranny.gamepedia.com/Spells.

**Loremaster**: Create a spell that requires 100 Lore. I also imagine that this one will have been done by accident by now, but just in-case, be sure to make one. You don't have to use it.

**Capstone**: Learn the last talent in any of the player’s 6 talent trees. If you've been playing a jack-of-all-trades previously, on this run, make an exception and invest enough points in a tree to learn the final talent in any given tree. You can re-invest your points at the start of a run, so if you're already of decent level, you can likely get this right out of the gate.

**By Our Powers Combined**: This is another achievement you might have not gotten yet - perform a combo with every companion. Combo abilities are unlocked at either Loyalty 3, or Fear 3, then simply use one combo with each companion. 

#### Fourth Run - 2nd Act Achievements

**Eternal Suffering**: This is only possible on the Rebal Path & by specifically not going to Lethian’s Crossing during the Conquest. When you go to Lethian's Crossing, choose to ally with the with the Bronze Brotherhood, who in turn will propose an alliance with the Stonestalkers (instead of the Earthshakers). As part of this quest, you'll keep Cairn alive, granting this achievement.

#### Fourth Run - Bastard's Wound Achievements

Note: There are several bugs related to viewing the murals in the Oldwalls before having recieved instructions from Reef-Talon to do so, so avoid doing so!

**The Bastard Tribe**: Saving the best quest for last, opt to support Mell in his endevaour to return Reef-Talon to the Wound. There isn't much to it, but it does require some specific conversation options. Namely, When Reef-Talon takes you to the mural, speak about it positively and taking any Lore checks available. Optionally, you can literally knock some sense into Reef-Talon with an Athletics check. Afterwards, Reef-Talon will send you to examine more murals. The best options are (via fabula_rasa once again):

- “The Oldwalls once had many different inhabitants...”,
- “Beastmen were meant to fight bane...”,
- “Many of the prints were formed with essence...”,
- “The beastwoman is showing her dominance...”,
- “What you’re seeing is a historical record....”.

This should convince Reef-Talon to return. At the end of the Bastard's Wound questline, she'll be available for choosing as a leader. Do so for the achievement.

**Let Sleeping Abominations Lie**: After Lexame let's you go see Reef-Talon, avoid Lullaby entirely for this achievement.

 ...and that's a wrap!
